# Frontend

This file is a router, not a rulebook. The rules live in four rulesets under `references/`; your first job is to load the smallest set of files that covers the request, state which you loaded in one sentence, then execute under their guidance. Loading nothing and freestyling produces the generic AI-slop output this skill exists to prevent; loading everything wastes context and creates contradictory instructions.

**The bar is not clean-and-correct — it is work a senior designer at Linear, Stripe, or Supabase would ship.** Correct-but-flat is a failure, not a finish. Protect the surface as hard as you protect the build: design is a first-class deliverable, not a one-shot decision you lock and walk away from.

## Phase 0 — Route (before any UI work)

| Request involves… | Read |
|---|---|
| Greenfield UI, a redesign, a new design system, a mockup, or a substantial visual decision | `references/design/README.md` FIRST. Use its design-system and tooling gates at this scope. For a localized edit in an existing system, read the nearby component and existing tokens instead. |
| Interaction or motion work — micro-interactions, animated components, transitions, gestures, hover/press/state feedback, "make it feel alive" | ALSO `references/design/interaction-skill.md`. The beui.dev catalog is the mandatory interaction reference: find the nearest pattern, read its real source through the file's curl recipe, and adapt the mechanism to `DESIGN.md` motion tokens. It stacks on the routed style skill — never replaces it. |
| Auditing performance / SEO / accessibility / quality, or changing architecture that materially affects them | ALSO `references/perfection/README.md`. Measure the affected routes in real Playwright Chromium and preserve UX while fixing regressions. |
| Looking up a concrete style, color palette, font pairing, chart type, landing-page structure, or UX guideline — or generating a project design system from keywords | `references/ui-ux-db/README.md`. A searchable CSV database with a CLI; a lookup tool, not a posture. Load on demand; `design` stays the source of truth for taste and the `DESIGN.md` contract. |
| Substantial design-system work that needs formal critique, debt, handoff, or synthetic user testing, or an explicit operating-layer ask | `references/designpowers/README.md` and only the lane files required by that deliverable. Do not add a review lane merely because `DESIGN.md` received a small update. |

For greenfield pages, redesigns, and broad visual work, load the design rules. Add perfection only when performance, SEO, accessibility auditing, or architecture affecting those surfaces is actually in scope. A localized component fix should use the existing design system and the narrowest relevant quality check.

## Design System and Component Workflow

Every implementation must choose one of these branches before UI code changes:

1. **Concrete visual reference:** the user supplied a reference — treat it as the visual contract, then handle it by kind:
   - **Static visual reference** (screenshot, generated mockup, Stitch/Imagen output, Figma export, overview, or annotated packet): load `references/design/image-to-code-skill.md` plus the relevant design/perfection files, extract the reference's exact tokens, layout geometry, copy, spacing, states, and responsive intent into `DESIGN.md`, then implement reusable primitives against that contract.
   - **Live site or URL reference** (the user names a site to clone or gives a URL): load `references/design/clone-from-url.md`. Drive a real browser and extract the runtime truth via `getComputedStyle` — tokens, layout geometry, default/hover/focus/active states, transitions and keyframes, and downloaded assets — into `DESIGN.md`, then clone-code reusable primitives against that contract.
   Final QA for both runs `/visual-qa` in reference-fidelity mode: compare the actual UI against the reference pixel-by-pixel and verify the code is an extensible design-system implementation, not a screenshot-matched one-off.
2. **Greenfield or fresh setup:** if the user gave no concrete visual reference, choose only the research lanes that can materially change the design. One strong embedded reference is often enough; add lazyweb or concept drafts when the brief is ambiguous or high-ambition. Run lanes in parallel only when they are independent, substantial, and expected to save more time than their context and synthesis cost. Record lanes that actually ran in `DESIGN.md`; do not create placeholder log entries for skipped lanes:
   - **Embedded references:** use `references/design/_INDEX.md` to shortlist 2-3 plausible Layer B references, then read exactly one Layer A style skill and one Layer B reference in full — every line, no partial reads (they are 200-500 lines; a sliced read produces the flattened token set this gate exists to prevent). Log the shortlist, the pick, and why. Use `open-design` only when the curated set has no fit; add `ui-ux-db` lookups for palette/type/domain questions.
   - **Lazyweb real-product screens:** READ `references/design/lazyweb.md` FIRST and run its recipe verbatim — do not improvise curl calls against lazyweb.com; the recipe mints its own anonymous token. Log the queries run, how many screens you actually VIEWED, and the layout grammar harvested — never pixel copies.
   - **Imagen concept drafts:** generate 2-3 imagen concept drafts, each seeded with the loaded Layer A + Layer B tokens (palette, type, material); pick the strongest and treat the chosen draft as the reference-fidelity contract. Log the draft paths and the pick.
   Synthesize every lane into `DESIGN.md`. Treat sources as source material, not mood labels: extract tokens, layout grammar, component anatomy, interaction states, motion, and taste decisions, then recombine them into project-specific primitives. Before laying out sections, inventory the content blocks and assign each a job — hook, explain, prove, compare, convert, navigate, retain — then order sections by the visitor's decision path, not by visual symmetry. Never freestyle past the selected references, never copy logos or brand-specific copy. Then run the Primitive Showcase Gate (`references/design/README.md` Phase 0) before any product screen.
3. **Existing project with `DESIGN.md` or a component system:** read it, follow it, and update it before implementation only when the requested work needs a new token, primitive, state, motion rule, accessibility constraint, accepted debt, or reference-fidelity requirement.
4. **Existing project with UI but no `DESIGN.md` and no reusable component layer:** for a localized request, preserve the current look with copy-nearby styling. Ask whether to extract a design system only when the requested change is broad enough that this choice materially changes scope or appearance.

For redesign or design-system work that creates or materially updates `DESIGN.md`, load `references/designpowers/README.md` + `lane-c-review.md` when personas, accessibility constraints, critique, debt, or handoff are part of the deliverable. Verify affected primitives, states, and screens with scoped visual evidence; use `/review-work` for significant implementation or a requested review.

## Ruleset 1 — design (`references/design/`)

The reference library has one architecture file, 12 taste skills (Layer A — *how to execute*), and 70 brand design systems (Layer B — *what it should look like*). Most non-trivial tasks load **one Layer A + one Layer B**. `README.md` carries the full routing flow, stacking rules, anti-patterns, and risk-scoped browser Design QA; `_INDEX.md` catalogs all 83 files with mood-to-brand mappings — read it whenever routing is not obvious from the tables below.

### Layer 0 — architecture

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `design-system-architecture.md` | The project has no `DESIGN.md` (defines the structure you must create first — 8 sections plus a greenfield-only `## 0. Research Log`), or you are extracting a design system from existing UI code. |

### Layer A — taste skills (pick AT MOST ONE style skill; they encode opposing philosophies)

| File | Read when the user says… |
|---|---|
| `taste-skill.md` | Neutral or operational UI with no surface ambition — internal tools, dashboards, "just make it usable". The safe default; do NOT settle here when the brief signals glossy / premium / startup-grade craft. |
| `gpt-tasteskill.md` | "Awwwards-tier", "wow factor", "cinematic", "scroll-triggered" marketing/landing experiences. |
| `minimalist-skill.md` | "minimal", "clean", "Notion-like", "Linear-like", "editorial". |
| `brutalist-skill.md` | "brutalist", "raw", "Swiss", "experimental", "anti-design". |
| `soft-skill.md` | "premium", "luxury", "calm", "expensive", "elegant", AND glossy / glassy / liquid-glass / startup-grade product surfaces — pair with a high-craft Layer B (`supabase`, `linear.app`, `vercel`, `stripe`). |
| `redesign-skill.md` | Improving EXISTING UI — "this looks bad", "fix the design". Audit-first workflow; never use on greenfield. |
| `image-to-code-skill.md` | "Generate the design first, then code it." Pair with one imagegen file below. |
| `output-skill.md` | Stacks on any style skill when output is incomplete — placeholders, `// TODO`, half-done components. |
| `stitch-skill.md` | Stacks on any style skill for Google Stitch compatibility or a `DESIGN.md` doc export. A complete worked export ships as `stitch-design-example.md`. |
| `interaction-skill.md` | Stacks on any style skill when work adds or changes interaction or motion. beui.dev-anchored: read the mapped component's source before designing an interaction; reduced motion always. |
| `imagegen-frontend-web.md` / `imagegen-frontend-mobile.md` / `imagegen-brandkit.md` | Image-only output (mockup, app-screen concepts, brand board). These NEVER write code — switch to `image-to-code-skill.md` if code is wanted. |

### Layer B — brand design systems (orthogonal to Layer A; stack freely)

When the user names a brand or site — "Linear-style", "like Stripe's landing", "Aside-style browser agent" — load `references/design/<brand>.md` as the token source of truth (palette, type scale, components, do/don'ts). Coverage includes `aside` `apple` `stripe` `linear.app` `notion` `vercel` `claude` `figma` `airbnb` `nike` `tesla` `spotify` `raycast` `revolut` and ~56 more; the full list with mood shortcuts is in `_INDEX.md`. Extract the tokens and apply them to the project's own content — never copy logos or trademarked imagery. If the named brand is missing, fall back to a Layer A mood match or the `open-design` skill.

### React dev tooling

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `react-dev-tooling-skill.md` | A React project lacks react-grab / react-scan / react-doctor, or you need per-framework install snippets and the dev-only gating pattern (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`). |

## Ruleset 2 — perfection (`references/perfection/`)

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | A performance, SEO, accessibility, or broad quality audit is requested, or frontend architecture affecting those surfaces changes. Carries the real-browser audit workflow and design-system compliance checks. |
| `react-perf-tooling.md` | Before ANY React audit. The Playwright + `playwright-lighthouse` + `react-scan/lite` injection recipe, per-route render budgets, and the React-specific root-cause checklist. Lighthouse 100 with 30+ unnecessary renders is NOT done. |

Audit CLI (build for production first; never measure a dev server):

```bash
uv run $SKILL_DIR/scripts/perfection/lighthouse-audit.py https://localhost:3000
```

Run mobile AND desktop presets, 3–5 runs, take the median, diagnose from the JSON report.

## Ruleset 3 — ui-ux-db (`references/ui-ux-db/`)

`README.md` documents the search CLI and the master-plus-overrides persistence pattern. The CLI (run from the ruleset directory so it finds `data/`):

```bash
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system -p "Project"   # full design-system generation
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --domain <domain>             # targeted lookup
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --stack <stack>               # stack best practices
```

Domains: `product` `style` `typography` `color` `landing` `chart` `ux` `react` `web` `prompt`. Stacks: `html-tailwind` (default) `react` `nextjs` `vue` `svelte` `astro` `swiftui` `react-native` `flutter` `shadcn` `jetpack-compose`.

## Ruleset 4 — designpowers (`references/designpowers/`)

`README.md` routes design operating-layer guidance from the pinned `Owl-Listener/designpowers` reference corpus into the existing frontend workflow. Load it for substantial design-system work or when the task explicitly needs personas, accessibility and cognitive constraints, design critique, design debt, handoff, synthetic user testing, motion guidance, or role-reference prompts. Add `lane-c-review.md` only when an independent critique is part of that scope. It does not replace this frontend skill, `/visual-qa`, `/ulw-plan`, `/start-work`, or `/review-work`; it supplies richer design context that must first be distilled into the project `DESIGN.md`, then used as the design-system contract for implementation and verification.

## Quick routes — most common requests

| Request | Load |
|---|---|
| "Build a landing page" (no direction given) | `design/README.md` + `design/_INDEX.md` shortlist → exactly one Layer B reference + `design/taste-skill.md` |
| "Aside-style AI browser / browser agent page" | `design/README.md` + `design/aside.md` + `design/taste-skill.md` |
| "Linear-style landing page" | `design/README.md` + `design/linear.app.md` + `design/taste-skill.md` |
| "Premium SaaS hero like Stripe" | `design/README.md` + `design/stripe.md` + `design/soft-skill.md` |
| "Improve this existing dashboard" | `design/README.md` + `design/redesign-skill.md` |
| "Add micro-interactions" / "animate this" / "make it feel alive" / "polish the interactions" | `design/README.md` + `design/interaction-skill.md` on top of the current style skill |
| "Build this screenshot / Imagen mock / Stitch output exactly" | `design/README.md` + `design/image-to-code-skill.md` + `/visual-qa` reference-fidelity mode |
| "Audit my site" / "make this page faster" | `perfection/README.md` (+ `perfection/react-perf-tooling.md` if React) |
| "Mockup image of a fintech app" — no code | `design/imagegen-frontend-mobile.md` (+ a Layer B brand if named) |
| "What palette/fonts fit a wellness brand?" | `ui-ux-db/README.md` → search CLI |
| "What do shipped apps in this space look like?" / design-direction research | `design/lazyweb.md` (curl-only) + `design/_INDEX.md` shortlist |
| "Set up this React project" | `design/README.md` + `design/react-dev-tooling-skill.md` |
| "Use designpowers", "make the design workflow stronger", "add personas/accessibility/debt/handoff" | `design/README.md` + `designpowers/README.md` (+ `perfection/README.md` if implementation or audit follows) |

## Shared axioms (all four rulesets agree — apply always)

- **Match design-system effort to scope.** Greenfield and broad redesign work establish `DESIGN.md`; localized work in an existing product follows its nearby tokens and components without forcing a new system document.
- **Concrete reference = contract.** When a screenshot, generated mockup, overview, or annotated reference exists, the implementation must match its pixels, copy, component structure, and responsive intent unless the user explicitly accepts a deviation.
- **Never weaken UX OR flatten the surface to buy points.** No dropping animations, hiding content, simplifying interactions, or replacing rendered/lit material with flat fills and flat geometric primitives for a Lighthouse score or a deadline. Hit 100 AND keep the surface dimensional — both, or neither.
- **No emojis as icons.** SVG icon sets only (Lucide, Heroicons, Radix, Phosphor).
- **GPU-composited animation only** — `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`; never animate layout properties.
- **Slop animation is forbidden — motion serves meaning.** Every animation or hover must map to a real interaction, state change, or affordance. A hover that changes nothing, motion on a non-interactive element, or a decorative micro-animation with no informational purpose is slop — do not add it.
- **Visual QA is scoped to risk.** Localized changes inspect affected routes, viewports, and states. Dual-review, every-page coverage, and reference-fidelity loops are reserved for significant redesigns, releases, or explicit fidelity work.

## When to load something else instead

| Situation | Load |
|---|---|
| Brand/style not among the 70 in `references/design/`, or the user says "Open Design" | `open-design` skill — the local nexu-io/open-design library (137+ design skills, 150+ design systems) |
| Driving a browser for the Design QA phase | `agent-browser` skill |
| Pure TypeScript/logic work with zero visual surface | `programming` skill alone — this skill adds nothing there |

## Activation

Use for any frontend, web UI, UX, visual, design, styling, layout, animation, performance, accessibility, or SEO work — building, redesigning, auditing, or generating mockups. Not for backend, CLI, or pure-logic tasks with no visual surface.
